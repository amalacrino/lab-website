**I’m a molecular ecologist interested in plant-microorganism interaction.**

I mix molecular biology, high-throughput sequencing and high-performance computing to answer important fundamental questions: how microbiomes influence the phenotype and fitness of their host? How microbiomes help invasive species to adapt to new environments? How microbes drive the evolution of their host?

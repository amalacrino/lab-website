Plant-associated microbial communities tightly interact with their host, and play a fundamental role in the regulation of important biological processes such as plant growth and development, response to pests and pathogens, stress tolerance, nutrient acquisition, and response to adverse environmental conditions. The consequences of plant-microbiome interactions extend beyond the host plant itself, influencing the functional traits of both plants and the ecological community with important effects on the ecosystem. This strong bound between the plant and its microbiome places the term “plant health” into a new perspective, where the relationship between plants and their enemies has to be expanded to consider the complex array of interaction with the inhabitants of the plant microbiome. Thus, microbiome science is not only transforming the way we understand plants, but also the way we approach plant protection and biological control. 

Our lab focuses on understanding the mechanisms that regulate the interactions between plants and their microbiome, and the consequences of these interactions on ecological communities. In particular, we focus on X major topics.

**Abiotic and biotic stresses**. Plants are constantly exposed to stressors, and so do their microbiomes. When plants experience drought, herbivory, or the attack from a pathogen they are able to recruit microorganisms from the environment via exudates and VOCs. Our lab is contributing to understanding the consequences of plant stresses on the plant microbiomes, and the mechanisms that plants and their associated microbes exploit to help counteracting different stressors.

**Genome-microbiome interactions**. Our results are clear: plant genotype plays a major role in assembling plant microbiomes. These results are supported by the extensive research in this field. However, we still know a little about the mechanisms behind this genotype-driven effect on the assembly of plant microbiomes. Our lab is working on dissecting the genetic architecture that plants use to recruit their own microbiome.

**Dysbiosis**. 

**Evolution**.





================


Plants, as many other organisms, associate with a plethora prokaryotes, microscopic
eukaryotes and viruses, often designated as the plant microbiota. These microbial
communities inhabit specific ecological niches (e.g. phyllosphere, rhizosphere, ...) and are
collectively referred to as the plant microbiome.  (Turner, James, and Poole 2013; Abdelfattah et al. 2018;
Berg et al. 2020), and together with the plant can also be regarded as a meta-organism, the
so-called “holobiont” (Vandenkoornhuyse et al. 2015). 


A wide portion of research in this field focused on the description of plant-associated microbial communities, only recently we began understanding the functioning of plant microbiomes, we still have a limited understanding of the 









The structure of plant-associated microbial communities depends on a multitude of factors, it is influenced by complex interactions between hosts, microbes, and associated environmental factors. The major factor that contributes in assembling plant microbial communities seems to be the compartment (Trivedi et al. 2020). Indeed, different plant organs (e.g., roots, leaves, flowers, fruits) associate with different communities and variation has been observed within the same compartment between the endosphere (the internal part) and the ectosphere (the external part) (Trivedi et al. 2020; Dastogeer et al. 2020). This can be explained by the different morphology, chemical properties and surrounding environment that characterize different compartments. Similar mechanisms have been proposed to explain the influence of plant species and genotypes in determining the structure of plant microbiomes (Dastogeer et al. 2020). The genotype effect also includes the initial set of microorganisms that are transmitted from seeds to new plants through vertical transmission (Abdelfattah et al. 2022; Berg and Raaijmakers 2018). Both soil and plant genotype have interlinked effects. Plant genotype determines the root architecture, metabolism, immune system functioning, and root exudate composition, which in turn drive the microbial recruitment from the soil. Soil, on the other side, provides the major source of microbial inoculum (Berg and Smalla 2009; Pieterse et al., 2016). In addition, environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity), plant stresses (e.g., drought) and health status (e.g., pathogens, pests) all influence plant-associated microbial communities (Rolfe et al., 2019). Indeed, when plants are under stress they have the ability to recruit microorganisms from the surrounding environment, mainly via volatile organic compounds and root exudates, helping them to overcome adverse periods (Rolfe et al., 2019). However, the mechanisms driving the recruitment of beneficial microorganisms are still poorly known, although they can be a valuable tool to design new sustainable plant protection strategies that unleash the plant microbiome instead of relying on synthetic agrochemicals.

Expected results and their relevance
From this project we expect to understand how plants recruit microorganisms when under biotic stress and the mechanisms that drive these processes. These results are relevant both from fundamental and applied perspectives. From a fundamental point of view, we will increase our knowledge on the mechanisms behind plant-microbe interactions. From an applied perspective, we will be able to identify markers that can be targeted by selection, providing a new tool to guide plant breeding. Both perspectives can contribute to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture. The results from this project will bring us a bit closer to understanding how we can manipulate the plant microbiomes to protect crops from diseases, thus reducing our reliance to synthetic chemicals in favor of a more sustainable agriculture, which is also one of the goals of the PNRR programme.



What are the rules behind plant microbiome assembly?

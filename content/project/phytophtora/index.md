Among the plant pathogens threatening agricultural and natural ecosystems *Phytophthora* stands out, with a significant number of species proven to be aggressive agents that threaten ecosystem stability and plant productivity on a global scale. Our research group is very active in the development of molecular detection methods, which include conventional and real-time PCR, and amplicon metagenomics analyses applied to different types of sample, including plant tissues (roots, bark, leaves, etc.), soil and water. Amplicon metagenomics analyses are performed using *Phytophthora*-specific primers as well as more broad-spectrum Oomycete primers. Interesting is also the identification and validation of new barcode genes which can be used in combination or as alternative to the ITS region of the rDNA to enable a more accurate discrimination of closely related taxa. In particular, the Ypt1 gene, initially proposed and valorized by our research group is currently widely recognized internationally and it has been included in [IDphy](http://idtools.org/id/phytophthora/index.php): an online resource for molecular and morphological identification of Phytophthora.

Other investigations, mainly conducted within broad international network of collaborations, mainly focus on the analysis of the population structure of Phytophthora spp. in natural ecosystems. Aim of these investigations is also the characterization of new isolates in order to identifying new Phytophthora species and hybrids as well as new Phytophthora-related genera, potentially threating our ecosystems. Connected to previous research lines is the molecular and biological characterization of important Phytophthora species with particular emphasis on P. infestans and P. nicotianae. For the latter pathogen, large-scale investigations conducted mainly through SNP and SSR have revealed a panmictic distribution of the species with extensive migration phenomena of the isolates and adaptation to specific hosts. Our results suggested the need for reconsideration of the concept of species and the consequent identification of specific pathoptypes within P. nicotianae sensu lato.

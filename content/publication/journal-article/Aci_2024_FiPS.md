abstract: Pear brown rot and blossom blight caused by Monilinia laxa seriously affect pear production worldwide. Here, we compared the transcriptomic profiles of petals after inoculation with M. laxa using two pear cultivars with different levels of sensitivity to disease (Sissy, a relatively tolerant cultivar, and Kristalli, a highly susceptible cultivar). Physiological indexes were also monitored in the petals of both cultivars at 2 h and 48 h after infection (2 HAI and 48 HAI). RNA-seq data and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) allowed the identification of key genes and pathways involved in immune- and defense-related responses that were specific for each cultivar in a time-dependent manner. In particular, in the Kristalli cultivar, a significant transcriptome reprogramming occurred early at 2 HAI and was accompanied either by suppression of key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in the modulation of any defense responses or by activation of DEGs acting as sensitivity factors promoting susceptibility. In contrast to the considerably high number of DEGs induced early in the Kristalli cultivar, upregulation of specific DEGs involved in pathogen perception and signal transduction, biosynthesis of secondary and primary metabolism, and other defense-related responses was delayed in the Sissy cultivar, occurring at 48 HAI. The WGCNA highlighted one module that was significantly and highly correlated to the relatively tolerant cultivar. Six hub genes were identified within this module, including three WRKY transcription factor-encoding genes: WRKY 65 (pycom05g27470), WRKY 71 (pycom10g22220), and WRKY28 (pycom17g13130), which may play a crucial role in enhancing the tolerance of pear petals to M. laxa. Our results will provide insights into the interplay of the molecular mechanisms underlying immune responses of petals at the pearâ€“M. laxa pathosystem.

We kick off the new year with a paper published in Frontiers in Microbiology. We show that plant genotype influences the structure of seed fungal communities across different cultivars of Triticum aestivum and Triticum turgidum. We also found that in T. aestivum the seed fungal microbiota is more influenced by stochastic processes, while in T. turgidum selection plays a major role. Collectively, our results contribute to fill the knowledge gap on the wheat seed microbiome assembly and, together with other studies, might contribute to understand how we can manipulate this process to improve agriculture sustainability.

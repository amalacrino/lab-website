New paper out on Environmental and Experimental Botany. We combined metabolomics and metagenomics to understand the effect of drought, heat, and their combination on the rhizopshere microbiome of maize plants. Our results contribute to the understanding of plant-soil interactions under the influence of abiotic stressors, which is key in paving the way towards an increased resilience to abiotic stresses, representing a powerful tool to craft the next generation of agricultural practices.
